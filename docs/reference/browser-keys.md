# Browser keys

Every key of `laneway web`, by view, as bound by default. `?` lists the
keys you can press right now; the key bar at the bottom shows the main
ones, and a click presses one. Keys for the terminal:
[Terminal keys](terminal-keys.md).

Where a key differs from the terminal's for the same action, the
terminal's is in the last column.

In the terminal every key goes to the agent except `ctrl+\`,

## Merge requests

The list (`g M`): `enter` opens the page, `d` its changes, `i` the Jira
issue beside, `o` GitLab.

The page:

| Key | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `1` `2` | Overview, Changes |
| `j` `k`, `]` `[` | next, previous file |
| `n` `N` | next, previous thread |
| `e` | edit it; on Changes the whole file |
| `z` `Z` | fold the file, all |
| `v` | an earlier push |
| `S` | submit the review |
| `A` | approve |
| `M` | merge |
| `C` | agent review |
| `i` | the Jira issue beside |
| `o` `r` | GitLab, reload |

Notes take the mouse: a click on a line number notes it, `shift`+click a
range; suggest, edit, drop, reply and resolve are buttons. A click on the
title or a field (reviewers, assignees, labels, target branch) edits it.

## Rules and settings

Rules: `t` try a change, `N` browser notifications, `R` reload.

Settings: `/` filters, `enter` or `space` changes, `h` `l` the previous,
next value, `delete` resets. On a key row, `enter` captures a new key.

## Mouse and touch

- A click opens the panel; `ctrl`, `⌘` or `shift`+click marks, as does a
  card's checkbox. A double-click opens it in Jira.
- Drag a card to a lane (a lane of several statuses splits into drop zones),
  or along its lane to rank it. Drag planning rows across sections, roadmap
  bars and their ends.
- Right-click anything with an issue key: its menu. A long press on a phone
  opens it as a sheet.
- Drag the panel's left edge to resize; a double-click resets it.
- `shift`+wheel or a sideways swipe scrolls lanes and the roadmap.

## Rebinding

Settings › Keyboard: `enter` on a row captures a new key and writes it to
the config. A key with a terminal action of the same name
([list](terminal-keys.md#rebinding)) goes to `ui.keys`, so the terminal
follows; it takes one key, not a sequence. The rest go to `ui.web_keys`, by
the id `scope:default key`:

```yaml
ui:
  keys:
    project: ctrl+p
  web_keys:
    "board:C": alt+c
```

`none` unbinds a key (No key when capturing).
