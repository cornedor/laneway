# Terminal keys

Every key of `laneway`, by screen, as bound by default. `?` shows them as
bound on your machine, paged with `←` `→`; from the panel it opens on the
panel's page. Keys for the browser: [Browser keys](browser-keys.md).

## Everywhere

| Key | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `?` | every key, as bound |
| `:` | the palette: actions of the focused pane, views, quick filters, boards, loaded and recent issues; from three letters all of Jira and the local index (`⌕`). Its `messages` row lists the last status-line messages |
| `#` | go to an issue by key or pasted URL |
| `,` | settings |
| `@` | switch or add a Jira site |
| `~` | home |
| `q` | quit; on the roadmap, planning, charts, the standup or the week it closes them |

## Merge requests

The list (`alt+m`): `enter` reads one in the panel, `d` its diff, `o`
GitLab, `r` refresh. In the panel: `i` the Jira issue it names, `p` its
pipeline's jobs (`enter` a job's log, `G` follows it), `A` approve, `M`
merge, `e` edit (title, draft, reviewers, assignees, labels, target branch,
description in `$EDITOR`), `C` agent review. Without a token for its GitLab
it says how to sign in; `r` tries again.

The diff:

| Key | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `tab` | files or diff |
| `]` `[`, `n` `N` | next file, next thread |
| `c` | note on the line, or reply to the thread |

| `e` | the whole file, again the changes |
| `z` `Z` | fold |
| `←` `→` | pan |
| `v` | an earlier push |
| `r`, `esc` | reload, back |

## Mouse

`ui.mouse: off` leaves the mouse to the terminal.

- A click selects, a second opens (`ui.double_click`). What a click acts on
  is underlined, and the pointer turns to a hand where the terminal draws
  pointer shapes.
- Drag a card to another lane, or along its own to rank it; it lands where
  its ghost shows. `esc` cancels.
- Right-click a card or row: its menu at the pointer.
- The header clicks: views, filters, chips, key hints, the timer, `✉`; the
  sprint bar opens the charts.
- In the panel: drag over text to copy it, drag the left border to resize,
  click a field to select it and again to edit; links, tabs, images and a
  comment's byline click.

## Rebinding

`ui.keys` rebinds an action to one key or a list:

```yaml
ui:
  keys:
    search: f
    mine: [m, M]
    roadmap: none     # unbound
```

A key bound to two actions on one screen is reported. The actions:

| Screen | Actions |
